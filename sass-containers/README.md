# Playing with Sass
CSS with superpowers
## What is Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets)?
Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.

Sass is a stylesheet language thatâ€™s compiled to CSS. It allows you to use **variables**, **nested rules**, **mixins**, **functions**, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax. Sass helps keep large stylesheets well-organized and makes it easy to share design within and across projects.

SCSS is not only CSS preprocessor out there. There is also [LESS](https://lesscss.org/) which provides same functionality with slightly different syntax and [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/) which is very flexible and provides advance features like conditionals and loops.

However, there is also [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) which provides low-level utility classes that can be combined into a creation of any design directly in HTML. So called **Utility-First-Approach**. No processing required. Good for development of rapid prototypes.

## Where to start?
The project home page: [Sass-lang.com](https://sass-lang.com/guide/)
### Plugin to VS Code: [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=glenn2223.live-sass)
- good to disable generating maps files by adding this setting into the user's preferences settings:
    `"liveSassCompile.settings.generateMap": false`
- 1st time of using it is good to turn on the instant compilations by executing a command from the Command Palette: `>Live Sass: Watch Sass`
- or pretty much read properly instructions for the extension usage
